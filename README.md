# 📚 Flashcard Quiz App

A powerful, offline-ready Flutter app designed to help students practice and revise using interactive flashcards. Developed as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**, this app supports both **Single Answer** and **MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions)** flashcards, ideal for quiz competitions and academic prep.
